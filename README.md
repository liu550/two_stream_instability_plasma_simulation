# Two stream instability plasma simulation
Use Particle in Cell method to simulate the turbulent phenomenon followed by two streams of plasma encountering each other (equal charge, opposite velocity with same magnitude). The simulation was run on Unity. A multithreading approach was implemented using Unity C# Job System.
